# README: Using the Conference Template

To use this template:

1. **Copy Code Blocks**: Paste the provided preamble and document body code blocks into your conference `.tex` file.

2. **Add Sections and Figures**: Include the section files (e.g., `sec/0_abstract.tex`, `sec/1_intro.tex`) and figures into your project directory. The `sec/` structure is for organizing content modularly for easier management.

3. **Bibliography**: Replace or add your `references.bib` file as needed.

This setup ensures your paper is well-structured and easy to maintain.
